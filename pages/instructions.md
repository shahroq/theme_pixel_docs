### 18. Manually add new classes, change styles, ...
Pixel comes with two specific files which house all your changes without losing them in the next updates. For using them:
1. Create a folder in `\application\config\` and name it `pixel_theme`
2. Copy & Rename `\theme_pixel\themes\pixel\css\less\custom.dev.less.tmp` to `\application\config\pixel_theme\custom.dev.less` (This will automatically include the new file into CSS without losing it in the next theme updates)
3. Copy & Rename `\theme_pixel\themes\pixel\css\less\variables.dev.less.tmp` to `\application\config\pixel_theme\variables.dev.less` (This will automatically include the new file into CSS without losing it on the next theme updates). You can copy each variable from `variables.less` to `variables.dev.less` and change it as you intend to.
4. [only for 5.7.x] Open `\theme_pixel\themes\pixel\css\style5.7.less` and comment out line 4 & 45
5. Clear the site cache.

PS1: Prior to 2.4, the custom files were placed in `\theme_pixel\themes\pixel\css\less\custom.dev.less`. So if you upgrade from older versions, you need to copy your custom file to the new location.


### 18.1 Manually add new scripts
1. Copy & Rename `\theme_pixel9\themes\pixel\js\custom.dev.js.tmp` to `\application\config\theme_pixel9\custom.dev.js` (This will automatically include the new file into the site footer without losing it in the next theme updates)


### 19. Change the Font Family
Pixel comes with exact instruction on how to manually change the embed and assign new fonts to your site:
1. First, proceed with the two steps at Instruction #18
2. Include your fonts at `\theme_pixel\themes\pixel\css\less\custom.dev.less` (A sample is provided in this file which you can uncomment/use it.)
3. Copy the lines that are responsible for assigning the fonts into the new `variables.dev.less` file. Some samples are also provided in this file which can be uncommented for your use case. 
 
 ### 19.1. Remove embeded google fonts
As a part of the theme, Pixel loads a couple of google fonts. If you need these fonts to be removed from the final produced CSS file, you can do it by choosing `no-external-fonts` preset:
```
Cog icon (concrete toolbar) > Design > Theme > Customize > Preset > No External Fonts
```


### 20. Setup the Coming Soon page
Change page type template to `Coming Soon`, then edit page properties, timer and background image, at `Dashboard > Pages & Theme > Pixel Options > Pages > Coming Soon`. You can also add blocks like Content and Social Icons via page editing UI.


### 21. Enable the Top Bar area
`Dashboard > Pages & Theme > Pixel Options > Header > Top Bar Area > Enable`

(Also, changeable for a specific page via `Top Bar: Enable` page attribute)


### 21.1 Make the Top Bar sticky
`Dashboard > Pages & Theme > Pixel Options > Header > Top Bar Area > Sticky Top Bar`

(Also, changeable for a specific page via `Sticky Top Bar` page attribute)

 
### 23. Add additional 'Main' Areas
Set `Main Area Number` page attribute
 

### 24. Using Express Objects
Pixel uses `Express Objects` for creating a list of Clients, Testimonials & Team Members. This feature is available for concrete5 version 8.1+.

When being installed, the theme creates these express objects. All you need to do is add entries via `/dashboard/express/entries`. After adding entries, you can display them with the core `Express Entry List` block and select one of the templates provided by the theme.
 

### 25. Parallax Effect
Pixel comes with built-in support for creating parallax areas. In order to make a parallax effect in an area:

1. Click on the area name, and select `Edit Area Design`
2. Click on the `Image (Background)` icon, and choose an image. Also, you can select one of the Repeat options there.
3. Click on the `Cog` (Advanced) icon, and insert `parallax` to the `Custom Class` textarea. This produces a parallax effect in the area.
4. In addition, there are a number of other classes that can be inserted into the `Custom Class` textarea, which customize the area:
    - `dark`: makes the content of area light (ideal for dark backgrounds)
    - `color-overlay`: adds an overlay on the top of the image.
    - `color-overlay-black`: adds a black overlay on the top of the image.
    - `color-overlay-white`: adds a white overlay on the top of the image.
    - `color-overlay-01` to `color-overlay-09`: adds opacity to color overlay layer (01-09).

  
### 25.1. Adding additional color overlays
Pixel already contains 2 `color-overlay-black` & `color-overlay-white` classes. These classes respectively blanket the area with standard black and white colors. Although these classes combined with transparent classes -- `color-overlay-01` to `color-overlay-09` -- can adequately do the job in many use cases, you might want to add another color. In this case, the new class can be defined in `custom.dev.less`:
```
.color-overlay-red:before { background-color: red; }
```


### 26. Translating to other languages
1. Get the latest translated version of the Pixel in your language [here](https://translate.concrete5.org/translate/package/theme_pixel). (If you already have a more completed version, translated into your language, you can complete it online for future users, or send it via a direct message to the Pixel developer, so we can do it.)
2. Copy translated `messages.mo` into `\packages\theme_pixel\languages\{language}_{country}\LC_MESSAGES\messages.mo`

  
### 27. Replacing the Pixel logo with your own logo
`Dashboard > Pages & Theme > Pixel Options > Header > Navigation > Standard Logo, Retina Logo, Standard Logo (Dark), Retina Logo (Dark)`


### 27.1 Assigning a different logo for a page
Copy the page-specific logo in `\application\config\pixel_theme\` folder and rename to `<your-main-logo-name>-<cID>`. Multiple logos including dark, retina etc can be assigned for a page.
(`cID` is your page ID)

### 27.2 Optimizing your logo size for the theme header
The theme contains two files (`\themes\pixel\images\logo.psd` & `\themes\pixel\images\logo@2x.psd`), which helps you place your logo inside the container. By resizing the logo to be contained inside the `Guide` lines, you can generate images that fit better inside the header. Also, the width needs to be adjusted, as very long logos might overlap the menu and search icon.


### 28. Using customized auth pages (Login, Register, Forgot Password)
Add below code to `\application\config\app.php`
```PHP
/*
* Route themes
*/
'theme_paths' => [
    '/login' => 'pixel',
    '/register' => 'pixel',
],
```


### 29. Replacing alternative home pages with the default home page
On the Sitemap drag the alternative page onto the default homepage, then select Copy Page: Replace `Home` with the copy of `Home 1`.


### 30. Assigning theme defined margin classes to a block
1. In the edit mode, click on the block and select `Design & Custom Template`.
2. Click on `cog` icon and add one of these classes into `Custom Class` field:
    - Standard Margin: `leftmargin`, `rightmargin`, `topmargin`, `bottommargin`, `allmargin`
    - XSmall Margin: `leftmargin-xs`, `rightmargin-xs`, `topmargin-xs`, `bottommargin-xs`, `allmargin-xs`
    - Small Margin: `leftmargin-sm`, `rightmargin-sm`, `topmargin-sm`, `bottommargin-sm`, `allmargin-sm`
    - Large Margin: `leftmargin-lg`, `rightmargin-lg`, `topmargin-lg`, `bottommargin-lg`, `allmargin-lg`


### 31. Changing the theme footer color
Once the theme has been installed, the footer color can be changed globally by using the built-in theme design customizer. Documentation on how to use this core functionality can be found [here](https://documentation.concrete5.org/editors/in-page-editing/the-toolbar/page-edit-drop-down/design).


### 32. Remove login/logout link from the footer
`Dashboard > Pages & Theme > Pixel Options > Footer > Remove Login/Logout Link`


### 32.1 Remove Account Menu from the footer
`Dashboard > System & Settings > Public Profiles > Show the account menu when logged in.`


### 33. Fix file_exists() issue
This problem, affecting some servers, is caused by the less interpreter library that has been used in concrete5. If you face this issue, starting from 2.3.0, you can fix it easily by following these steps:
1. Create a folder in `\application\config\` and name it `pixel_theme`
2. Copy & Rename `\theme_pixel\themes\pixel\css\less\custom.dev.less.tmp` to `\application\config\pixel_theme\custom.dev.less` 
3. Copy & Rename `\theme_pixel\themes\pixel\css\less\variables.dev.less.tmp` to `\application\config\pixel_theme\variables.dev.less`
4. Clear the site cache.


### 34. Change the email/telephone in Social Link block
`Dashboard > Pages & Theme > Pixel Options > Blocks > Social Links`


### 35. Create a non-clickable menu item
Add the `navigation_link_disabled` attribute to the page you want to disable and check the attribute.


### 36. Verify whether the theme has been installed, upgraded, or uninstalled completely
In order to check if the requested operation has completely gone through, go to Dashboard > Reports > Logs and make sure the corresponding log entry exists:
1. In the case of installing without sample content: `Pixel Theme v.x INSTALLED successfully in x seconds.`
2. In the case of installing with sample content: `Pixel Theme v.x with sample contents INSTALLED successfully in x seconds.`
3. In the case of upgrading to a newer version: `Pixel Theme UPGRADED successfully to v.x in x seconds.`
4. In the case of uninstalling: `Pixel Theme v.x UNINSTALLED successfully in x seconds.`

If you don't find one of these 4 messages in your log list, it indicates the matching process hasn't been completed. Check #37 for probable causes & solutions.


### 37. Theme has not been installed, upgraded completely
After confirming the theme has not been installed or upgraded thoroughly, these solutions can be tried:
1. Increase PHP `max_execution_time`: In many cases, when installing the theme with sample contents, the default value of `max_execution_time` (30 seconds) is not enough for the server to create all the sample pages in your c5 instance. For fixing this, the value can be increased temporarily and the theme should be reinstalled afterward.


### 38. Find out the block/template used on demo/your site
On Pixel, all blocks are wrapped inside a container that has data attributes for signaling the information about that block. By inspecting a block on the browser with (Firefox, Chrome, etc) inspector, you will see 3 data attributes:

1. data-area="Main : xxx" : the area of the block
2. data-block="xxx" : block type eg: html, feature, faq etc
3. data-template="xxx" : block template name
4. class="xxxx" : custom classes often have ':' in their name
