## Customizing Blocks

If you have used the previous version of the Pixel, you know that there were more than 100 block templates included in the theme.

In the new version, we designed a creative system to make the templates customizable via the `Custom Class` feature. In the new version, while the number of templates for each block is limited to 1-3 templates, the customization and combinations are countless and you can customize buttons, designs, and sizes in all blocks with this new feature. 

The best way to discover the possibilities and combinations is to install the theme with sample content and check how different instances of blocks are made. 
If you are comfortable using the browser `Inspect Element` feature, you can also check the `Custom Class` used for a specific class on the [demo site](http://pixel9.killerwhalesoft.com).

To customize a block appearance
1. Select one of the pixel templates for the block
2. Click on the `Cog` icon: Custom Class and you should be able to see a list of customization options. Choose relevant classes and Save the block.
